       "{'comment': \"This dataset represents the production of 1 kg of nickel ore, beneficiated to 16% Ni in Quebec (Canada) for the year 2010. \\nThis dataset is a disagreggation of the existing dataset ''nickel mine operation, sulfidic ore'', which contains smelting and refining on top of the mine operation. The disagreggation was done  because primary data was available for nickel mine operation but not for subsequent stages of smelting and refining. Thus, the production volume of this dataset is already included in the global dataset ''nickel mine operation, sulfidic ore, GLO''. Until data on smelting and refining become available, this dataset cannot be used as part of a life cycle assessment.\\nThe concentrate produced is composed of 16% Ni; 4% Cu; 0.24% Co; 0.61 g/t Au; 10.84 g/t Ag; 2.8 g/t Pt; 9.68 g/t Pd; 0.95 g/t Rh.\\nThe sulfidic nickel ore is extracted in an underground mine, where 7.21 kg of ore are extracted per kg of concentrate produced. The recovery rate (metal in ore/metal in the concentrate) is 90% for Ni and 82% for Cu. \\nThe  concentrate produced is sent to a smelter located in Ontario (Canada) and to a refinery located in Norway (both excluded).\\nNo specific data were available except for some emissions to water and air publicly available. Most of the data were taken from the Environmental Impact Assessment of the only Nickel mine in Quebec dated from 1993 and converted with a conversion factor (ore mined in 2010/expected amount of ore according to ElA). Some extrapolations were made based on ecoinvent datasets.\\nNone\\nGeography:  This module represents the production of nickel concentrate in the Québec region.\\nTechnology:  Mining is done underground, followed by beneficiation. Overburden (2.67 kg/kg concentrate) and tailings (6.99 kg/kg concentrate) are disposed on the mining site. \\nTime period:  The dataset represent the activity in 2010. Uncertainty has been adjusted accordingly.\",\n",
